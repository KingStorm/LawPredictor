We use ~900000 features during training and testing.

Total number of training examples: 3800
(1900 are positively labeled, 1900 are negatively labeled)

Total number of testing examples: 398
(199 are positively labeled, 199 are negatively labeled)

Kernel of SVM is radial basis function: exp(-gamma*|u-v|^2)
Gamma = 0.005
Accuracy ~ 62%

Confusion matrix:
[[124   75]
 [ 78  121]]
